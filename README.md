Many believed in the beginning of Covid lockdown that adoption rates would increased and euthanasia rates would decreased as people isolated at home would look for an animal companion duriong the pandemic. As we are both avid animal lovers and rescuers, we want to look closer at the data.

The information contained herein was derived from data supplied by Shelter Animals Count. Shelter Animals Count specifically disclaims all responsibility for any analysis, interpretations, conclusions and opinions contained in the information presented.

## Week 1 - Project Planning
We utilized Google, Kaggle, and different state Department of Agriculture websites to search for animal shelter data.

* Shelter Animals Count provided the national dataset we used found through Kaggle.
* Georgia's state data was found using Georgia Department of Agriculture's website.
* Texas data was found for major cities though Google, but data was either to sparse to be able to analyze (Dallas and Houston) or too old to fit our parameters (Austin).

---
## Week 2 - Data Wrangling
Data wrangling was done using R in RStudio and Python in Jupyter Notebook.

We isolated common variables with which to do comparisons, recoded, and transformed our data for analysis.

---
## Week 3 - Exploratory Analysis
Using R, we looked at:

* Sum
* Mean
* Standard Deviation
* Range
* Dependent t-Test

---
## Week 4 - Analyze Data
Using R, we ran:

* Stepwise and Multiple Linear Regression
* Discriminant Function Analysis

In Python, we did Machine Learning to Predict Outcomes: 

* Structural Equation Modeling
* Pearson Correlation

## Week 5 - Data Visualization and Reporting
Tableau was utilized for visualizing our findings. Those visualizations are then used in our slide show presentation to further explain our findings.

## Week 6 - Presentation
And here we are!
